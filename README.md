It's a unique animation transitions done in Swift 2.3 using XCode 8 with Swipe gestures


Created cube transition swift file to handle the animations on viewcontrollers.

You can add n number of viewcontrollers to it for the animation. It will do transitions in either right or left swipes. And transitions are rounded.

In Cube Transitions file

Implemented own custom protocol methods to handle the transitions.. For the look and feel added scrollView for the cubecontrollers while handling the swipes.. done with the calculating angle on the top of basic angle using M_PI_2.
